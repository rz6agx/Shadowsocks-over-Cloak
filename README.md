# Shadowsocks-over-Cloak
> A script to automate the installation of Shadowsocks with Cloak plugin on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24

On GitHub, you can find the [HirbodBehnam/Shadowsocks-Cloak-Installer project](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/Shadowsocks-Cloak-Installer), which supports Debian, Ubuntu, and other distributions.

This repository provides a script to automate the installation and configuration of Shadowsocks with the Cloak plugin on Debian and Ubuntu systems. Cloak obfuscates Shadowsocks traffic as legitimate HTTPS traffic, making it more difficult to detect and block.

A similar project, [HirbodBehnam/Shadowsocks-Cloak-Installer project](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/Shadowsocks-Cloak-Installer), exists. However, it has limitations in terms of supported operating system versions, primarily focusing on Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22. This script addresses this limitation by offering support for newer releases of Debian and Ubuntu, ensuring compatibility with the latest system updates.
